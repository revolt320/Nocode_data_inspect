# Custom Data Inspection Tool (Streamlit)

A custom data inspection tool built with Streamlit is an interactive web application that allows users to upload, explore, and analyze datasets without needing to write code.

It typically provides features such as:

File Upload – Supports CSV, Excel, or other formats for importing datasets.

Basic Information – Displays filename, number of rows, columns, column names, and data types.

Data Preview – Shows a scrollable or paginated view of the dataset.

Summary Statistics – Automatically computes descriptive statistics (mean, median, min/max, counts, nulls, etc.) for numerical and categorical columns.

Unique Value Analysis – Lists distinct values in a column, along with frequencies (useful for categorical exploration).

Filtering Options – Lets users apply conditions like “equals,” “contains,” “is null,” etc., to subset the data dynamically.

Group & Aggregation – Enables summarizing data by grouping columns and applying aggregate functions (sum, average, count, etc.).
